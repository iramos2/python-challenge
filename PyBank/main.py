# Your task is to create a Python script that analyzes the records to calculate each of the following values:
# The total number of months included in the dataset
# The net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period
# The changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period, and then the average of those changes
# The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period
# The greatest decrease in profits (date and amount) over the entire period
